    <h1>TRADING</h1>
    <P> I am passionate about trading and have been actively trading for the past few years as a hobby. I enjoy the
        challenge of trying to predict the future direction of the markets and the satisfaction of making a successful
        trade. I have learned a great deal about the financial markets through my trading experience, and I continue to
        learn more every day. I am also constantly looking for new ways to improve my trading skills.

        I believe that trading can be a very rewarding hobby, and I am excited to continue learning and growing as a
        trader. I am also open to the possibility of one day trading as a profession.

    </P>
